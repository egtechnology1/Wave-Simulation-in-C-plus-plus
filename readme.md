This is The Wave Simulation Program Written in C++ based in "Graphihcs.h" Library using some function of Codeblocks.
If you want to run this code in your machine. I really suggest you the codeblocks with graphics.h added in it. In
 Other IDE can also be run but some change should be done.
         
         
                  This consists following feature:
          - Generate Square Wave (all based on inputs of Amplitude and Frequency)
          - Generate Cosine Wave
          - Addition of Sine and Cosine Wave
          - Subtraction of Sine and Cosinge Wave
          -Generates Waves                         ------
                  1) Square Waves
                  2) Traingular Waves
          - Option to change Font and Background Color as Specified..

                 Codding challenge: As, in all cases if frequency of signal increases then, it narrows itself.But
       When we increase frequency of square wave then, it boarders itself..
       So, anyone who accept this challenge can repair this to work good.
